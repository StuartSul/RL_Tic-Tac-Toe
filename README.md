# RL_Tic-Tac-Toe

![Gameplay Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StuartSul/Five_in_a_Row/master/sample/MainScreen.png)

## Overview
This is a graphic tic-tac-toe artificial intelligence project, made so that I can practice implementing reinforcement learning algorithms while going through "Reinforment Learning: An Introduction" by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton (http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html)

The game and overall interface was borrowed from my own project which I worked on 2 years ago for a good practice on Python 3 GUI: https://github.com/StuartSul/Five_in_a_Row

You can start playing against the pretrained AI with the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```

To play against another person, make AI fight against itself, or train the AI, you should modify config.py
